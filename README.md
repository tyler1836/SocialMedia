# SocialMedia Back End
## Using `Mongoose` and `MongoDB` to demonstrate crud operations 
* If you want to test the code feel free to fork the repo and test it out on your own computer
* User endpoints for getting `User`, getting a single user by `UserId` adding friends by using two `UserId`s with a special endpoint
* Creating thoughts that belong to a certain `User` by using a post route with `UserId`
* Creating reactions that belong to thoughts by using a post route with a `ThoughtId`
* All post routes can also be used with put operations and delete operations using same Ids and endpoints
